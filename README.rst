``micromodelsim`` (for "microstructural model simulator") is a Python package
for generating diffusion-weighted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals from
microstructural models. It is designed to help in the development of new
microstructural models and to enable efficient training of machine learning
models for parameter estimation.
